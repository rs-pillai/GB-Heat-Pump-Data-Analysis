Analysis of domestic heat pump electricity consumption in Great Britain using smart meter data from the Electrification of Heat (EoH) study, including clustering and seasonal profiles
This repository contains my analysis of electricity consumption from domestic heat pumps in **Great Britain**, based on the **Electrification  of Heat (EoH) study** dataset.  
It complements my work on the NIE Smart Meter Trial by providing a comparative perspective between GB and NI.
## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Develop seasonal weekday and weekend consumption profiles for heat pumps.  
- Apply clustering methods (KMeans, PCA, Silhouette) to identify typical usage patterns.
- Provide insights into peak demand, load variability, and daily shape.

- ## ðŸ”§ Tools & Methods
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Clustering**: KMeans, PCA, silhouette analysis  
- **Data Processing**: hourly resampling, normalization, season/day separation

- 
## ðŸ“Š Results (highlights)
- Seasonal load shapes for GB heat pumps.  
- Identification of representative clusters.

The GB dataset originates from the **BEIS Electrification of Heat (EoH) study**.

This repository therefore provides:
- **Code & workflows**
