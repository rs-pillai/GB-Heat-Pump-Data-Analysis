GB Heat Pump Data Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for analysing domestic heat pump electricity consumption in Great Britain, based on the Electrification of Heat (EoH) study. The analysis develops daily load-shape profiles, seasonal segmentation, and clustering to identify representative usage patterns and their variability.

This project complements my related work on the NIE Smart Meter Trial, enabling structured GB‚ÄìNI comparisons of residential heat pump demand.

Objectives

Construct seasonal weekday and weekend profiles of heat pump demand.

Apply K-Means clustering with silhouette analysis and the elbow method (WCSS) to identify typical daily usage patterns.

Assess hourly variability of clusters using boxplots.

Provide a reproducible pipeline while ensuring confidential raw data is not shared.

Methods (Summary)

Data Preprocessing

Resampled half-hourly data into hourly demand profiles.

Applied completeness checks (e.g., ‚â•90% daily coverage) and handled missing values.

Split dataset into winter vs summer and weekday vs weekend subsets.

Normalisation

Applied shape-based normalisation (z-score or scaling to daily mean) to highlight usage patterns over absolute magnitude.

Clustering

Ran K-Means clustering for multiple 
ùëò
k values (e.g., 2‚Äì10).

Selected optimal cluster count using:

Elbow method (WCSS) for compactness.

Silhouette score for separation.

Visualisation & Results

Produced median daily profiles per cluster.

Generated hourly boxplots to capture variability within clusters.

Summarised cluster metrics and relative shares of households/days.
